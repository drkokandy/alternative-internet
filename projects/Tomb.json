        "description": "Tomb is a system to make strong encryption easy for everyday use. A tomb is like a locked folder that can be safely transported and hidden in a filesystem. Its keys can be kept separate; for example, you can keep the tomb on your computer and its key on a USB stick or a remote SSH shell.\nTomb is written in code that is easy to review and links shared components: it consists of a ZShell script and desktop integration apps; it uses standard GNU tools and the cryptographic API of the Linux kernel (dm-crypt) via cryptsetup.",

Tomb implements and encourages OPSEC best-practice, and comes with bind and execution hooks, steganography of keys and fast search over filenames and contents, and a graphical user interface.",
