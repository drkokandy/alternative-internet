        "description": "In 2008, a number of free software developers and activists gathered at the FSF to attempt to answer the question \u201cWhat should software freedom look like on the participatory web?\u201d Their answer, the Franklin Street Statement has lead to the development of autonomo.us community, and free software projects including Identi.ca and Libre.fm.\n\nIdenti.ca and Libre.fm address the need for micro-blogging and music sharing services and software that respect users\u2019 freedom and autonomy.\n\nGNU MediaGoblin emerges from this milieu to create a platform for us to share photos, video and other media in an environment that respects our freedom and independence. In the future MediaGoblin will provide tools to facilitate collaboration on media projects.",
